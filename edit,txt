Meeting 19th Nov
- Fix the function generating the fault graph: It is currently 
displaying the nodes with a different measurement value and not the 
change in measurement.
- Add the 0 weight link between all the ghost nodes
- Add the dummy nodes
- Have function to generate another graph that separates the
temporal ghost nodes (different node label but pointing to the same 
node in the volume lattice)
- minimum weight matching by using max and subtracting the edge 
weights from a large number (set maxcardinality=True)
